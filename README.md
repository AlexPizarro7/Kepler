## Dockerization
We like Docker because it removes your local machine from the equation. Run everything in their own virtual environments the same way we would deploy to production!

Be sure to install Docker CLI to your local machine

To build the architecture to your machine run `docker-compose build`

And to run the application simply run `docker-compose up`
